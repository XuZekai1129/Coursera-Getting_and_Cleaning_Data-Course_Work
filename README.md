# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course work
Contains R script and codebook for peer graded assignment
# Files:
Codebook.md detailed illustrate how to use run_analysis.R and how the data is cleaned and transformed.

run_analysis.R contains the code to perform 5 steps described below:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

TidyData.txt is the output of cleaned data in run_analysis.R
